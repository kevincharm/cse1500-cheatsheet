# Foreword

This course, in a nutshell, is a shit show. We are being tested on the most irrelevant crap - details we don't ever need to remember as webdevs (hello [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)) and API-specific shit from Express!

Then they expect you to be able to compile badly-written JavaScript in your head after they teach it to you in ~4 weeks. Don't even get me started on the project. The education quality here is laughable. Students will not take away any skills from this course.

Here I'll outline some important information you should know for the exams. Please tweet any suggestions/requests to [@kevincharm](https://twitter.com/kevincharm). You can also submit a PR on the [github repo](https://github.com/kevincharm/cse1500-cheatsheet).

If anyone important is reading this; contact me. I am keen to teach CSE1500 next year (trade for ECs or waive my tuition) because students paying >EUR10k deserve better education than this.
